Here’s a **polished README** tailored for BBVA that frames your **calculator** and **evolution simulator** as part of your broader *Solar Umbrella / Solar Tree* initiative.
This is designed to be **professional, clear, and easy to follow** for stakeholders unfamiliar with GitHub or technical tools.

# ☀️ Solar Umbrella Project – Tools & Pilot Planning

## Overview

The **Solar Umbrella Project** is an innovative climate-resilient infrastructure initiative that transforms public spaces into nodes of clean energy generation, electric mobility, and urban cooling.

It integrates:

* **Solar umbrellas and solar terrazas** for distributed renewable power.
* **EV charging infrastructure** embedded in urban streetscapes.
* **Battery storage** for resilience and peak load management.
* **Energy-as-a-service** for adjacent businesses and residents.
* **Digital tools** to model, simulate, and optimize the transition to clean energy.

This repository contains **two key tools** developed for the BBVA Sustainable Business Unit to support decision-making, financial modeling, and pilot planning.

## 📦 Contents

1. **Solar Energy & Financial Calculator**

   * Allows users to input technical and financial parameters for a solar umbrella installation.
   * Generates outputs for energy production, savings, costs, payback periods, and environmental benefits.
   * Scenario comparison feature to analyze different configurations.

2. **Solar Umbrella Evolution Simulator**

   * Interactive tool to visualize how a simple solar umbrella can evolve into a **Climate Pod**, **EV Oasis**, and eventually a **peer node** in a city-wide energy ecosystem.
   * Includes microgrid and virtual power plant concepts.
   * Available in English and Spanish.

3. **Project Concept & Pilot Plan** *(documents)*

   * Business plan
   * Financial model
   * Concept designs
   * Pilot deployment strategy

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.9+ installed
* Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

**Run the Calculator:**

```bash
streamlit run calculator/calculator.py
```

**Run the Evolution Simulator:**

```bash
streamlit run simulator/solar_evolution_simulator.py
```

## 🌍 Online Access (Preferred)

If you do not have Python installed, you can run the apps directly via **Streamlit Cloud** or other cloud deployment platforms.
Links will be provided here once deployed:

* Calculator: \[Streamlit link]
* Simulator: \[Streamlit link]

If you’d like, I can now also prepare:

* **A matching folder structure** ready for you to upload.
* **A step-by-step guide** for uploading this README and files to GitHub.
* **A one-click deployment guide** so BBVA can open the apps without installing anything.

Do you want me to prepare that **next** so your repo is ready for BBVA?
I can make sure it’s clear even for someone who’s never used GitHub before.
